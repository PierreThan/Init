# DNS que vous utilisez

# INFO :
# How do you find out DNS server IP address? How do you find out current DNS server IP address?
# Under Linux, FreeBSD and all UNIX-like operating systems you have a file called /etc/resolv.conf.
# It is often known as the resolver configuration file.

# resolv.conf - resolver configuration file

# The resolver is a set of routines in the C library that provide access to the
# Internet Domain Name System (DNS). The resolver configuration file contains information
# that is read by the resolver routines the first time they are invoked by a process.
# The file is designed to be human readable and contains a list of keywords with values that
# provide various types of resolver information. The configuration file is considered a
# trusted source of DNS information

# DEDUCTION :

# /etc/resolv.conf will give you the IP address of the DNS server you are using
# when typing ls -l /etc/resolv.conf, we get :
# lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  22 Nov 20  2016 /etc/resolv.conf -> ../var/run/resolv.conf
# this is a symbolic link

/var/run/resolv.conf
