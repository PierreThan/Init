# INFO :
# traceroute : print the route packets take to network host
# The traceroute command is used in Linux to map the journey that a
# packet of information undertakes from its source to its destination.
# One use for traceroute is to locate when data loss occurs throughout
# a network, which could signify a node that's down.
# Because each hop in the record reflects a new server or router between
# the originating PC and the intended target, reviewing the results of a
# traceroute scan also lets you identify slow points that may adversely affect
# your network traffic.

# INFO :
# traceroute outputs :
# Each row represents a "hop" along the route.
# Think of it as a check-in point where the signal gets its next set of directions.

# format is : Hop #	RTT 1	RTT 2	RTT 3	Name/IP Address
# Hop Number - This is the first column and is simply the number of the hop along the route

# RTT Columns - The next three columns display the round trip time (RTT) for your packet to
# reach that point and return to your computer. This is listed in milliseconds.
# There are three columns because the traceroute sends three separate signal packets.

# Domain/IP column - The last column has the IP address of the router.

# nat1 is the NAT router who makes the link between you (local network) and the outside world

# COMMAND :
traceroute slash16.org
