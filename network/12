# Trouvez l’IP qui vous a été assignée par le serveur dhcp

# INFO :
# DHCP server :
# network server that automatically provides and assigns IP addresses,
# default gateways and other network parameters to client devices.
# It relies on the standard protocol known as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
# or DHCP to respond to broadcast queries by clients.
# A DHCP server automatically sends the required network parameters for clients
# to properly communicate on the network. Without it, the network administrator
# has to manually set up every client that joins the network, which can be cumbersome,
# especially in large networks. DHCP servers usually assign each client with a unique
# dynamic IP address, which changes when the client’s lease for that IP address has expired

# ipconfig : view and control IP configuration state
# utility that communicates with the IPConfiguration agent to retrieve and set IP configuration parameters.
# (internet protocol configuration) is a console application of some operating systems that displays
# all current TCP/IP  network configuration values and refresh Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
# (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) settings.
# (TCP = Transmission Control Protocol)

# ipconfig getoption interface-name (option-name | option-code)
#    Prints the BOOTP/DHCP option with the given name or option code integer value.

# we want to apply ipconfig getoption on en0 (your physical network interfaces)
# and retrieve the server_identifier

# COMMAND :
ipconfig getoption en0 server_identifier
