# Awk  :
# utility that enables a programmer to write tiny but effective programs
# in the form of statements that define text patterns that are to be searched
# for in each line of a document and the action that is to be taken when a
# match is found within a line. Awk is mostly used for pattern scanning
# and processing.
# It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that matches
# with the specified patterns and then performs the associated actions.
# Spliting a Line Into Fields : For each record i.e line, the awk command
# splits the record delimited by whitespace character by default and stores
# it in the $n variables. If the line has 4 words, it will be stored
# in $1, $2, $3 and $4 respectively. Also, $0 represents the whole line.

# COMMAND :
ifconfig en0 | grep broadcast | awk '{print $6}'
