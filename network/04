# Identifiez la gateway par d√©faut dans la table de routage

# INFO :
# default gateway :  node in a computer network using the internet protocol
# suite that serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no
# other route specification matches the destination IP address of a packet.

# A default gateway lets devices in one network to communicate with devices
# in another network. If your computer, for example, is requesting an internet
# web page, the request first runs through your default gateway before
# exiting the local network to reach the internet.

# netstat :
# Print information about network connections, routing tables, interface statistics,
# masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.
# -n : shows network addresses as numbers (normally netstat interprets
# addresses and attempts to display them symbolically).
# -r : shows the routing tables

# netif = network interfacex

# route : Route is a utility used to manually manipulate the network routing tables.  It normally is not needed
#        -n  Bypass attempts to print host and network names symbolically when reporting actions.
#			(The process of translating between symbolic names and numerical equivalents can be quite time consuming,
#			 and may require correct operation of the network; thus it may be expedient to forget this, especially when
#            attempting to repair networking operations).


# COMMAND :
netstat -nr | grep default | grep en0 | awk '{print $2}'

# OR : route -n get default | grep gateway | awk '{print $2}'
