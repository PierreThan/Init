# INFO :
# DNS : Domain Name System

# nslookup is a program to query Internet domain name servers.

# It is a network administration tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS)
# to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or any other specific DNS record.
# It is also used to troubleshoot DNS related problems.

# Nslookup has two modes: interactive and non-interactive.

# Interactive mode allows the user to query name servers for information about
# various hosts and domains or to print a list of hosts in a domain. à

# Non-interactive mode is used to print just the name and requested information for a
# host or domain.

# Interactive mode is entered in the following cases:
#
#       1. when no arguments are given (the default name server will be used)
#
#       2. when the first argument is a hyphen (-) and the second argument is the host name or
#           Internet address of a name server.
#
#       Non-interactive mode is used when the name or Internet address of the host to be looked up is
#       given as the first argument. The optional second argument specifies the host name or address
#       of a name server.
#
#       Options can also be specified on the command line if they precede the arguments and are
#       prefixed with a hyphen. For example, to change the default query type to host information, and
#       the initial timeout to 10 seconds, type:
#
#           nslookup -query=hinfo  -timeout=10

# COMMAND :
nslookup slash16.org | grep 'Server:' | awk '{print $2}'
