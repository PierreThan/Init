# Récupérez la liste des interfaces réseau de la machine sans afficher aucun détail
# pour ces interfaces. Vraiment juste la liste des noms.

# INFO :

# ifconfig is a command line interface tool for network interface configuration
# and also used to initialize an interfaces at system boot time.

# Once a server is up and running, it can be used to assign an IP Address
# to an interface and enable or disable the interface on demand.
# It is also used to view the status IP Address, Hardware / MAC address,
# as well as MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) size of the currently active interfaces.
# ifconfig is thus useful for debugging or performing system tuning.
#
# The -a flag may be used instead of an interface name. This flag
# instructs ifconfig to display information about all interfaces in the system.

# The -l flag may be used to list all available interfaces on the system, with
# no other additional information :
#		1: lo 	 	– Loopback interface.
#       2: gif0  	- Generic tunnel interface. It's used to tunnel IPv4 traffic to an IPv6 network and back.
#       3: stf0  	- IPv6 to IPv4 ("six to four") tunnel interface : It's a bridge connection that exists to help us transition from IPv4 to the IPv6 standard.
#       4: XHC20 	- USB network interface
#		5: en0   	– Ethernet network interface (cable).
#		6: ppp0		– Point to Point Protocol network interface which can be used by dial up modem, PPTP vpn connection, or 3G wireless USB modem.
#       7: p2p0		- Airdrop interface (apple p2p)  p2p0 is a point to point link (usually VPN)
#       8: awdl0	- Apple Wireless Direct Link (Bluetooth) to iOS devices
#		9: en1		– AirPort network interface (wifi).
#      10: bridge0	- Software bridge between other interfaces
#      11: utun0	- Used for "Back to My Mac"
