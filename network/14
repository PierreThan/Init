# 14. Quel est le fichier contenant les entrÃ©es locales DNS ?

# INFO :
# The hosts file is used to map hostnames (in other words domains) to IP addresses.
# With the hosts file you can change the IP address that you resolve a given domain name to.
# This change only affects your own computer without affecting how the domain is resolved worldwide.
# This is particularly useful when you wish to see how a website will look like when hosted
# on a different server without making any DNS changes to your domain.

# in Linux -> /etc/hosts

# Therefore the file that contains the Domain Name Sytem is the /etc/hosts
# here it has localhost and broadcasthost

# COMMAND :
/etc/host
