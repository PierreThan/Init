# SUBJECT :
# Figure out the PID of the SSHD service

# PID :	
# A PID (i.e., process identification number) is an identification number that is automatically 
# assigned to each process when it is created on a Unix-like operating system.
# A process is an executing (i.e., running) instance of a program. 
# Each process is guaranteed a unique PID, which is always a non-negative integer.

# SSHD service : Solid State Hybrid Drives
# It's a traditional spinning hard disk with a small amount of fast solid-state storage built in. 
# A solid-state drive - or SSD - is a storage drive made entirely of memory chips instead of the 
# spinning magnetic platters you'd find inside a traditional hard disk. 
# It's a bit like the storage in a USB thumb drive, but much faster.
# So an SSHD is basically a hard drive and SSD in one, which is why it's called hybrid.

# COMMAND :
systemctl status ssh | grep PID | awk '{print $3}'
