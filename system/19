# systemctl command, which is the central management tool for controlling the init system
# To see a list of all of the active units that systemd knows about, we can use the list-units command

# list-unit-files
# The list-units command only displays units that systemd has attempted to parse and load into memory.
# Since systemd will only read units that it thinks it needs, this will not necessarily include all of
# the available units on the system. To see every available unit file within the systemd paths, including
# those that systemd has not attempted to load, you can use the list-unit-files command instead

# COMMAND :
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service | grep "enabled" | awk -F'.service' '{print $1}'
