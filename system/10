# Quelle commande permet de lister les tables de partitions des disques ?

# 9 commands to check hard disk partitions and disk space on Linux
#    1.fdisk  : display the partitions and details like file system type.
#               However it does not report the size of each partitions.
#    2.sfdisk : similar to fdisk, but with more features. It can display the size of each partition in MB.
#    3.cfdisk : linux partition editor with an interactive user interface based on ncurses.
#               It can be used to list out the existing partitions as well as create or modify them.
#    4.parted : list out partitions and modify them if needed.
#    5.df     : not a partitioning utility, but prints out details about only mounted file systems.
#               The list generated by df even includes file systems that are not real disk partitions.
#    6.pydf   : Improved version of df, written in python. Prints out all the hard disk partitions in a easy to read manner.
#    7.lsblk  : Lists out all the storage blocks, which includes disk partitions and optical drives.

#	 8.blkid  : Prints the block device (partitions and storage media) attributes like uuid and file system type.
#               Does not report the space on the partitions.
#    9.hwinfo : general purpose hardware information tool and can be used to print out the disk and partition list.
