# Donnez une commande qui détermine l’état du service SSH

# INFO :
# Latest version of Ubuntu such as Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS or 18.04 LTS
# and others use the systemctl command to control ssh server on Ubuntu.

# Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network
# services securely over an unsecured network.
# Typical applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution,
# but any network service can be secured with SSH.

# SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client–server architecture,
# connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server.

# OpenSSH is a freely available version of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol family of
# tools for remotely controlling, or transferring files between, computers.
# Traditional tools used to accomplish these functions, such as telnet or rcp,
# are insecure and transmit the user's password in cleartext when used. OpenSSH
# provides a server daemon and client tools to facilitate secure, encrypted remote
# control and file transfer operations, effectively replacing the legacy tools.

# The OpenSSH server component, sshd, listens continuously for client connections
# from any of the client tools. When a connection request occurs, sshd sets up the
# correct connection depending on the type of client tool connecting.
# For example, if the remote computer is connecting with the ssh client application,
# the OpenSSH server sets up a remote control session after authentication.
# If a remote user connects to an OpenSSH server with scp, the OpenSSH server daemon
# initiates a secure copy of files between the server and client after authentication.
# OpenSSH can use many authentication methods, including plain password, public key, and Kerberos tickets.

# COMMAND :
systemctl status ssh
